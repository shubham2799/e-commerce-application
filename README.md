# E-commerce Application
An e-commerce web application developed over Node.js using Express.js framework, MongoDB database and EJS templates to render the front-end. The application provides an end-to-end shopping experience to users, from product browsing and selection to order placement and post-purchase interaction through customer reviews and order history.

NOTE: If you are running the code on your machine and are connected to your local database, then you will first need to add products to the database. For that, you will need to sign up with the admin account i.e. username: "admin" (you may use any password).
Once you are logged in with the admin account, you will have the access to add new products to the database as well as edit/remove them.
