# e-commerce-application
An e-commerce web application developed over Node.JS using Express framework with MongoDB serving the database requirements.

NOTE: If you are running the code on your machine and are connected to your local database, then you will first need to add products to the database. For that, you will need to sign up with the admin account i.e. username: "admin" (you may use any password).
Once you are logged in with the admin account, you will have the access to add new products to the database as well as edit/remove them.
